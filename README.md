# lavapotion

An experimental [Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink) client for [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).
Currently incomplete and not ready for public use, however almost all functionality Lavalink provides
for clients is supported, just untested as of the 24th November 2018.

Feel free to add this package via Git:
```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:lavapotion, git: "https://github.com/SamOphis/lavapotion.git"}]
end
```

Hex releases will be made available once this project becomes stable enough for use in production.
You should consider all releases straight from Git to be experimental and not fit for safe use, whereas
Hex releases should all be tested and fit for production.
